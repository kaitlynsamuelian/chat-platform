ORIGINAL DETAILED VERSIONS - FOR REFERENCE

This folder contains the original, highly detailed versions of the three main project documents.

These were created initially but were too comprehensive and prescriptive for a project just getting started. They're saved here for reference in case you want to pull specific sections or details later.

Files:
- README-detailed.md - Extremely comprehensive README (598 lines)
- PROPOSAL-detailed.md - Very thorough independent study proposal (616 lines)
- CONTRIBUTIONS-detailed.md - Exhaustive contribution documentation (1172 lines)

The current versions in the root directory are simplified, more flexible, and more realistic for an evolving project.

Date backed up: October 2025
